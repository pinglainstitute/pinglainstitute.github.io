- title: "Enigme: Generative Text Puzzles for Evaluating Reasoning in Language Models"
  image: enigme.jpeg
  authors: John Hawkins
  description: Transformer-decoder language models are a core innovation in text based generative artificial intelligence. These models are being deployed as general-purpose intelligence systems in many applications. Central to their utility is the capacity to understand natural language commands and exploit the reasoning embedded in human text corpora to apply some form of reasoning process to a wide variety of novel tasks. To understand the limitations of this approach to generating reasoning we argue that we need to consider the architectural constraints of these systems. Consideration of the latent variable structure of transformer-decoder models allows us to design reasoning tasks that should probe the boundary of their capacity to reason. We present enigmen, an open-source library for generating textbased puzzles to be used in training and evaluating reasoning skills within transformer-decoder models and future AI architectures.`

  authors: Rohitash Chandra, Jayesh Sonawane, Jahnavi Lande
  description: Anti-vaccine sentiments have been well-known and reported throughout the history of viral outbreaks and vaccination programmes. The COVID-19 pandemic caused fear and uncertainty about vaccines, which has been well expressed on social media platforms such as Twitter (X). We analyse sentiments from the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic and study the public behaviour on X during the planning, development, and deployment of vaccines expressed in tweets worldwide using a sentiment analysis framework via deep learning models. We provide visualisation and analysis of anti-vaccine sentiments throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We review the nature of the sentiments expressed with the number of tweets and monthly COVID-19 infections. Our results show a link between the number of tweets, the number of cases, and the change in sentiment polarity scores during major waves of COVID-19. We also find that the first half of the pandemic had drastic changes in the sentiment polarity scores that later stabilised, implying that the vaccine rollout impacted the nature of discussions on social media.

- title: "Science and Hinduism share the vision of a quest for truth"
  image: white_flower.png
  description: Hinduism seeks to provide insight into the nature of the universe and is not antithetical to science. Rohitash Chandra explains why he sees value in bringing together science and spirituality in the quest for knowledge. -- "I envision a world where we are fearless in bringing science and religion (spirituality) together. Hinduism is built on the philosophical foundations of the search for the truth and shares this vision with modern science. However, the focus of Hinduism has largely been on investigating the nature of consciousness. Several universities in the West have a Centre for Consciousness. This is just the beginning of the singularity in the quest for knowledge, where science and spirituality merge. We need to embrace science but also embrace humanities and spirituality, and ensure that our current and future generations are not a target of scientism that forces one to view science as a dogmatic religion."

- title: "Recursive Deep Learning Framework for Forecasting the Decadal World Economic Outlook"
  image: recursive.png
  description: The gross domestic product (GDP) is the most widely used indicator in macroeconomics and the main tool for measuring a country’s economic output. Due to the diversity and complexity of the world economy, a wide range of models have been used, but there are challenges in making decadal GDP forecasts given unexpected changes such as emergence of catastrophic world events including pandemics and wars. Deep learning models are well suited for modelling temporal sequences and time series forecasting. In this paper, we develop a deep learning framework to forecast the GDP growth rate of the world economy over a decade. We use the Penn World Table as the data source featuring 13 countries prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as Australia, China, India, and the United States. We present a recursive deep learning framework to predict the GDP growth rate in the next ten years. We test prominent deep learning models and compare their results with traditional econometric models for selected developed and developing countries. Our decadal forecasts reveal that that most of the developed countries would experience economic growth slowdown, stagnation and even recession within five years (2020-2024). Furthermore, our model forecasts show that only China, France, and India would experience stable GDP growth.
